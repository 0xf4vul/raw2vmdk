General
---------- 
    raw2vmdk is an OS independent Java utility that allows you to mount
raw disk images, like images created by "dd", using VMware, VirtualBox or any
other virtualization platform supporting the VMDK disk format.

It analyzes the raw image and creates an approprietly formatted ".vmdk"
file that can be used to mount the image right away.

The ".vmdk" file is created based on the "vmdk.tpl" template file.

CAUTION:
    *Do not* remove or edit the vmdk.tpl file unless you are really
sure about what you're doing!


Features
-----------
A feature list follows:
    o Simple command line interface
    o No need to convert the image, run raw2vmdk and mount
        the created .vmdk file right away
    o OS independent


Usage
------

java -jar raw2vmdk.jar <raw image> <vmdk outfile>

Note to MS Windows users:
    When passing the command line arguments escape all slashes in path names.

For example:
    java -jar raw2vmdk.jar C:\\images\\raw\\disk.img D:\\images\\vmdk\\disk.vmdk
